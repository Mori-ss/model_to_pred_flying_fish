# 🐟 Flying Fish — Prediction Project

This project is dedicated to predicting the weight of a fish based on its characteristics (length, height, width, and appearance).  
The model is trained on the training dataset and makes predictions for the test dataset.

## , Datasets
- **TrainDataFlight.csv** — training data (with known weight).
- **TestDataFlight.csv** — test data (without the weight to predict).
- **TestDataFlight_with_pred.csv** — the result of the model (with the predicted weight).
